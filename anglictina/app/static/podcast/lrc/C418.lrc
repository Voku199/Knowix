[00:00.094] Welcome to the Deep Dive.
[00:02.298] If you've ever been building something huge in Minecraft,
[00:05.851] maybe just a dirt hut,
[00:07.173] and that really simple, beautiful piano music
[00:09.458] just sort of floats in.
[00:10.50] Then yeah, you know C418's work,
[00:12.209] even if you don't know the name Daniel Rosenfeld.
[00:14.133] Exactly.
[00:15.135] And today we're doing a deep dive into him, C418.
[00:18.327] He's the musical mind
[00:19.89] behind that iconic Minecraft soundtrack.
[00:22.415] And it's more than just game music, right?
[00:24.058] It's really a story about
[00:26.129] sticking to your guns artistically,
[00:28.012] being clever with tech limitations,
[00:30.577] and honestly, fighting for your work against,
[00:32.968] well, corporate giants.
[00:34.33] Yeah, our mission today is to track that journey.
[00:36.294] He went from intense manual labor
[00:39.807] to being globally recognized.
[00:41.29] We wanna really get into the genius of his ambient sound.
[00:44.897] And also that big legal fight,
[00:46.727] the one that means there's a whole finished album
[00:48.971] we've never actually heard in the game.
[00:50.454] Right, we've looked at biographies, musical analyses,
[00:53.58] stuff written about the cultural impact,
[00:56.091] trying to piece together why this music
[00:57.974] is just so, so enduring.
[00:59.738] Okay, so to really get it,
[01:00.94] we need to start at the beginning, right?
[01:02.81] The contrast is pretty stark.
[01:04.854] It really is.
[01:06.056] Daniel Rosenfeld, born 1989 in Chemnitz, Germany.
[01:10.251] He wasn't living some artist's dream life.
[01:12.415] He had this job, described as an awful manufacturing job.
[01:16.008] 10 hours a day.
[01:17.651] Backbreaking manual labor on an assembly line.
[01:20.977] That's intense.
[01:22.019] Super intense.
[01:23.048] And that context, I think, is key.
[01:25.172] Music wasn't just a profession waiting to happen.
[01:27.656] It was his escape.
[01:29.179] His brother Harry encouraged him, but it was a hobby.
[01:31.811] You can almost imagine the repetition of that factory work.
[01:36.339] Maybe that's why ambient music appealed.
[01:38.129] That sense of space, something different.
[01:40.373] Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.
[01:41.615] It was his mental out.
[01:43.098] And this independence, this personal space,
[01:45.89] it kind of connects to how he approached things later.
[01:48.495] So this hobby leads him online to Tigsource,
[01:51.607] the indie game forum.
[01:52.489] Exactly, and that's where he bumps into Marcus Person,
[01:55.682] who's making Minecraft.
[01:57.017] Notch had a problem.
[01:57.939] Music, right.
[01:58.767] He couldn't find anything that worked.
[02:00.17] Yeah, anything traditional, anything loop-based.
[02:02.053] It just felt, quote, cheap and out of place
[02:04.057] for this weird, blocky, open-world thing he was building.
[02:07.45] Okay, so C-418 steps in, offers his ambient stuff,
[02:11.698] and this is the crucial moment, isn't it?
[02:14.53] The deal.
[02:15.372] The absolute key.
[02:16.734] Minecraft was tiny then.
[02:18.297] Pay was minimal.
[02:19.619] But the agreement they made, it was huge creatively.
[02:23.453] C-418 keeps 100% of the rights and royalties,
[02:26.779] full creative freedom.
[02:28.129] 100%.
[02:29.451] He wasn't an employee making music for hire.
[02:32.497] He was licensing his art, his escape to the project.
[02:35.85] That changes everything.
[02:37.092] Because he didn't have to follow the trends.
[02:38.815] The whole pixelated indie game thing
[02:40.498] usually meant chiptunes back then.
[02:41.847] Right, and he specifically rejected that.
[02:44.052] He said he disliked the style,
[02:45.654] and also, very honestly, that he sucked at making it.
[02:49.168] Okay, so instead of matching the blocky look
[02:50.971] with blocky sounds.
[02:52.093] He did the opposite.
[02:53.683] Minimalist, ambient stuff, piano, strings, synths.
[02:56.755] Very acoustic feeling, very calm.
[02:58.318] It creates this amazing contrast
[03:00.789] with the sometimes stressful gameplay.
[03:02.953] Was that a big risk, though,
[03:03.969] going against the visual grain like that?
[03:05.558] Oh, for sure.
[03:06.44] But it worked incredibly well.
[03:07.709] The minimalism was partly philosophy,
[03:09.432] partly dealing with tech limits.
[03:10.995] Ah, right, the Minecraft sound engine back then
[03:13.453] was super basic, couldn't loop properly.
[03:15.67] Right.
[03:16.512] No location-specific audio.
[03:17.995] Exactly, couldn't do smooth loops,
[03:19.598] couldn't trigger music based on where you were.
[03:21.868] So how do you score a potentially infinite world
[03:25.195] with those limits?
[03:26.116] What did he do?
[03:27.078] His brilliant idea was silence.
[03:29.99] Use silence.
[03:30.912] Make the music play randomly, sporadically,
[03:33.637] sometimes long gaps with nothing.
[03:35.788] So the limitations became a feature.
[03:38.753] Totally, it wasn't just a workaround.
[03:40.276] It was a design choice.
[03:41.358] You're just mining away,
[03:42.48] maybe feeling a bit bored or lonely,
[03:44.417] and then suddenly, this gentle piano track
[03:47.155] like Sweden fades in.
[03:49.159] And it makes that moment feel significant,
[03:52.338] it elevates the mundane,
[03:53.794] it creates that feeling of instant nostalgia
[03:55.918] people talk about.
[03:56.76] It's because the music wasn't wallpaper,
[03:58.47] it was an event.
[03:59.392] Wow.
[04:00.233] Okay, so that leads into the actual albums.
[04:01.996] Volume Alpha came out in 2011.
[04:03.88] That's the core sound, isn't it?
[04:05.59] That's the foundation.
[04:07.059] Simple, often piano-led, lots of ambience.
[04:10.599] Analyses often mention tracks like Sweden or Minecraft.
[04:13.631] They capture this feeling of melancholy,
[04:17.078] maybe loneliness, but also wonder.
[04:20.03] The sound of being alone in this huge, empty world.
[04:23.677] That really nails the early Minecraft vibe.
[04:26.268] Then Volume Beta in 2013.
[04:28.953] The game was much bigger by then.
[04:30.716] And the album reflected that.
[04:32.119] It's huge, 140 minutes, 30 tracks,
[04:34.831] nearly double Alpha,
[04:36.273] and the music starts getting a bit more specific.
[04:39.119] How so?
[04:39.947] Well, it's still often random,
[04:41.029] but you start getting music
[04:42.191] tied to certain conditions or dimensions.
[04:44.475] Main menu has its own theme.
[04:46.399] Overworld, creative mode, the nether, the end.
[04:50.66] Let's talk about creative mode.
[04:51.595] The music there feels different, more active.
[04:52.797] Yes, tracks like Aria Math.
[04:54.935] That's the first time C418 really brought in
[04:56.952] percussion drums, drum kits, into the main soundtrack.
[04:59.476] Why there?
[05:00.318] Think about it.
[05:01.133] In Survival, a driving beat might be distracting,
[05:02.99] maybe stressful, but in Creative,
[05:04.673] where you're just building limitlessly,
[05:06.115] that rhythm, that tempo, it actually helps you focus,
[05:08.988] keeps you in the zone.
[05:10.07] Like a soundtrack for pure creation.
[05:12.314] That makes sense.
[05:13.396] And the dimensions.
[05:15.239] The nether must have been tricky.
[05:16.668] Definitely.
[05:17.51] The nether tracks are generally ominous, dissonant.
[05:20.676] They sound like this dangerous, fiery place.
[05:23.668] But crucially, they often have these
[05:25.151] robust, hopeful mid-sections in the nether.
[05:28.798] Yeah, it captures that balance, right?
[05:30.588] It's terrifying, but you're there for a reason
[05:32.952] to find valuable stuff, fortresses, treasure.
[05:36.011] It's terror mixed with the hope of reward.
[05:38.229] And then there's the end.
[05:39.591] That final boss fight music.
[05:40.873] Oh, the end track.
[05:41.835] It's epic, 15 minutes long.
[05:43.719] And what it does is weave in these distorted,
[05:47.272] evocative remixes of nearly every single track
[05:50.237] you've heard on your journey.
[05:51.319] So it's like your whole Minecraft life
[05:53.23] flashing before your ears.
[05:54.672] Pretty much.
[05:55.514] It makes that final confrontation
[05:56.716] feel genuinely transcendent.
[05:58.159] A culmination of everything.
[05:59.348] It's genius sound design.
[06:00.977] Speaking of sound design, fun fact, huh?
[06:03.596] Yeah, a great one.
[06:04.678] C418 did the sound effects too, not just the music.
[06:07.229] You know, the ghast, that horrible crying sound it makes.
[06:10.395] Unforgettable, yeah.
[06:11.477] That's his pet cat.
[06:12.559] Just, you know, heavily processed recordings of his cat.
[06:15.752] No way, that's amazing.
[06:17.435] Taking something familiar and making it utterly alien.
[06:21.135] Okay, so this period seems like peak creative control,
[06:24.314] peak success, but then things change.
[06:27.587] Big change.
[06:28.428] 2014, Microsoft buys Minecraft, buys Mojang.
[06:32.636] And this immediately creates friction
[06:34.319] with C418's deal, doesn't it?
[06:36.029] Immediately.
[06:36.951] Because C418 owns his music 100%.
[06:40.117] Microsoft, like most big companies,
[06:42.294] prefers the standard work-for-hire model.
[06:44.391] They pay you to make something,
[06:45.914] and then they own it outright.
[06:47.237] So C418 was essentially licensing his music to Minecraft,
[06:51.511] but Microsoft wanted to own
[06:53.194] any new music he made for Minecraft.
[06:55.118] That's the core of it.
[06:56.467] The sources say Microsoft told him
[06:57.91] he couldn't keep composing for the game
[06:59.473] unless he gave up those rights entirely.
[07:01.276] And for him, that was a non-starter
[07:03.12] based on that original deal he made with Notch.
[07:05.11] Absolutely, so stalemate.
[07:06.553] And the cost of that stalemate is huge, musically.
[07:09.077] Massive.
[07:09.919] C418 has confirmed he had an entire finished third album
[07:13.192] ready to go into the game, fully done.
[07:15.035] But because of the rights dispute,
[07:16.518] it's never been added to Minecraft.
[07:17.987] It just sits there, unreleased in the game context.
[07:20.953] Yeah.
[07:21.794] He did manage to get three final tracks in
[07:24.319] for the 1.13 Aquatic update in 2018.
[07:27.912] That was the end of his official involvement.
[07:29.676] And since then, Microsoft has brought in other composers.
[07:32.788] Yep, talented people like Lena Raine, Kumi Tanioka.
[07:36.795] But crucially, the music they compose
[07:39.00] is owned by Microsoft Studios.
[07:40.99] It fits the standard corporate model.
[07:43.154] And the style feels different, too, doesn't it?
[07:45.278] The newer music often seems more tied
[07:47.148] to specific places, like biomes.
[07:49.593] It generally is, more biome-specific, as you say.
[07:52.318] Which is a valid approach, of course,
[07:53.64] but it's different from C418's original idea
[07:56.192] of the music being this universal,
[07:57.955] sort of ambiguous atmosphere for the whole world.
[08:00.907] So he stuck to his principles on ownership,
[08:03.552] but it meant he couldn't continue
[08:04.995] with the game he helped define.
[08:06.437] That's the trade-off.
[08:07.68] But, and this is fascinating,
[08:09.269] that insistence on ownership seems to have given his work
[08:11.994] this incredible cultural staying power,
[08:14.439] independent of the game's current owners.
[08:16.63] You mean like the Library of Congress recognition?
[08:18.794] Exactly.
[08:19.635] In 2023, Minecraft Vol. Alpha gets added
[08:22.427] to the U.S. Library of Congress's
[08:24.11] National Recording Registry.
[08:25.633] That's huge.
[08:26.715] Wow, what do they say about it?
[08:28.478] Recognized for its gentle electronic music
[08:31.39] and its power to create instant nostalgia.
[08:34.516] It was only the second video game soundtrack album
[08:37.108] ever added, after the original Mario theme.
[08:39.953] And because he owns it?
[08:41.436] Because he owns it.
[08:42.357] All that recognition, all the historical weight,
[08:44.708] it accrues directly to him, the artist.
[08:47.393] Not to Mojang, not to Microsoft.
[08:49.397] It cements his independent legacy.
[08:51.748] That independence seems to define his next steps, too.
[08:54.633] He didn't just keep making music.
[08:56.036] Well, he is, but he's also diversified.
[08:58.307] He co-founded an independent game studio, Ivy Road,
[09:01.914] partnered with Debi Reading, who made The Stanley Parable,
[09:04.478] and Carla Zamanja.
[09:05.747] Interesting, what are they working on?
[09:07.23] Their first game is called WanderStop.
[09:09.234] It's slated for 2025, described as a cozy simulator
[09:13.108] themed around burnout.
[09:14.51] Huh.
[09:15.552] A game about burnout from the guy who started in a factory
[09:18.438] and fought corporate ownership?
[09:20.308] Feels fitting.
[09:21.31] Very fitting, and he's composing the soundtrack for it,
[09:23.754] naturally.
[09:24.596] And Beyond Games.
[09:25.437] He seems quite outspoken now, too.
[09:27.067] Yeah, he's based in Austin, Texas now,
[09:29.031] and has used his platform pretty strongly
[09:31.475] for human rights advocacy.
[09:33.145] He's spoken out for transgender rights, black rights,
[09:35.95] making clear statements like transgender lives matter
[09:38.395] and anything else is unacceptable.
[09:39.998] So using his voice beyond just the music,
[09:43.19] and commercially, he's still doing well.
[09:44.553] Oh, yeah.
[09:45.475] In 2023, he actually hit number one
[09:47.759] on Billboard's Emerging Artists chart.
[09:50.471] So the music still resonates commercially,
[09:52.635] even years after his main Minecraft contributions ended.
[09:55.867] Okay, so let's wrap this up.
[09:57.069] We've got this artist, C418.
[09:59.594] His unique ambient sound came out of personal taste,
[10:02.80] but also technical limits,
[10:04.55] and this incredibly rare deal for total ownership.
[10:07.756] Right.
[10:08.598] That deal let him create something truly groundbreaking
[10:11.51] that defined a generation of gaming.
[10:13.553] And even though it led to conflict
[10:15.197] with a massive corporation later.
[10:17.04] That very conflict and his refusal to give up ownership
[10:20.553] might be why his work now
[10:22.116] has this incredible historical weight,
[10:24.627] like the Library of Congress recognition.
[10:26.831] It's protected, in a way.
[10:28.274] It really seems that way.
[10:29.196] His independence secured its legacy.
[10:30.959] It's a powerful story about artistic integrity.
[10:33.551] Which leads us to a final thought for you, the listener.
[10:36.997] In this world where huge companies
[10:38.947] often want to own everything outright,
[10:41.873] does an artist holding onto 100% ownership,
[10:44.478] like C418 did, actually make their work more likely to last?
[10:48.231] Does it give it kind of cultural permanence,
[10:49.914] making it significant beyond just its corporate use?
[10:52.84] Something to definitely think about.
[10:54.149] Thanks for joining us on this deep dive.
