    "Are you sick of me?",
    "Would you like to be?",
    "I'm trying to tell you something",
    "Something that I already said",
    "You like a pretty boy",
    "With a pretty voice",
    "Who is trying to sell you something",
    "Something that you already have",
    "But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right",
    "She might let you stay, but just for the night",
    "And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along",
    "She might want a kiss before the end of this song",
    "Because love can burn like a cigarette",
    "And leave you with nothing",
    "And leave you with nothing",
    "While the others talked",
    "We were listenin' to Lover's Rock",
    "In her bedroom",
    "In her bedroom",
    "And if you start to kiss",
    "And the record skips",
    "Flip it over",
    "And sit a little closer",
    "But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right",
    "She might let you stay, but just for the night",
    "And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along",
    "She might want a kiss before the end of this song",

    "And leave you with nothing",
    "And leave you with nothing",
    "Now, how many men have you kissed?",
    "Very few",
    "But you offered me a kiss, why?",
    "Such a foolish reason, I'm afraid",
    "I just wanted to kiss you",
    "Do-do, do-do-do-do-do",
    "Do-do, do-do-do-do-do",
    "Do-do, do-do-do-do-do",
    "Do-do, do-do-do-do-do",
    "Because love can burn like a cigarette (do-do, do-do-do-do-do)",
    "And leave you alone with nothing (do-do, do-do-do-do-do)",
    "And leave you alone with nothing (do)"
